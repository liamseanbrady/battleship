# Battleship

### Requirements

- A command line game where one player is the user at the command line and the other user is the computer (i.e., an algorithm).
- The UI consists of the player's board and the computer's board being visible with the status of the destroyer (1 square), cruiser (2 squares) and the battleship(3 squares). Each player's board is a 5x5 grid with numbers marking each row and column. There is a space in each grid square that represents either a blank space (marked by /) or a space occupied by part of or all of one of the ships (marked by X).
- The prompt for the user to select a square on the grid is "Please select a square (such as 3, 5) to open fire!".
- The players' names are both hard-coded.
- When the game starts (before the UI is shown) the game engine will randomly fill both players boards with blank spaces and battleships.
- If a ship is sunk, then its status should be updated on the UI.
- When all of one of the players ships are sunk, the program should exit and the message "Player Name is the winner!" should show.
